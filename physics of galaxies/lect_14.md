## AGN Components

### QSO & AGN

QSOs (quasi-stellar objects) are the most luminous AGNs, they look look point-like. Some facts about AGNs:

- x-ray emission due to accretion 
- Broadline in type I AGNs (due to a fast rotation disk around the accretion disk), type II AGNs have only narrow lines (especially in the optical)
- AGNs are either radio quiet or radio loud, radio loud implies the presence of a jet due to a strong magnetic field
- An excess of blue light 
- Some AGNs contain light variability
- Optical light polarization, which might make the broad line regions visible even for type II AGNs

### The central engine

The central engine of an AGN is a supermassive black hole accreting gas, this BH has an event horizon the size of the solar system. With gas being accreted at a rate of $1M_\odot/\text{yr}$. This gas being accreted forms a disk which is heated by friction. Which results in UV, optical, and x-ray radiation.

The energy that is released by accretion is approximately 

$$\Delta E = \frac{GMm}{R}$$

where $M$ is the mass of the central BH, $R$ the radius of the accretion disk, and $m$ the accreted mass. And the accretion luminosity, i.e. the energy radiated due to accretion. is given by

$$L=\frac{GM\dot{M}}{R}\approx 1.3\cdot 10^{21}\bigg(\frac{M/M_\odot}{R/\text{km}}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{M}{\text{g}/\text{s}}\bigg)\,\text{erg}/\text{s}$$

where we assume a steady accretion rate $\dot{M}$.

### The broad-line region

Extends to around 0.01-0.1 pc around the central engine, but is not directly visible. Here the gas is extremely hot (producing velocities around $v\approx 10^3$ to $v\approx 10^4$ km/s), this can only be the result of the presence of supermassive BHs.

### The dusty torus

To observe it we need to look in the IR, mainly in the mid-IR. Current evidence shows that the torus is rather clumpy and not homogeneous.

### The narrow-line region

Extends to about 100-1000 pc, outside of the central engine, essentially the host galaxy itself. This region contains gas clouds with velocities ranging from 100-500 km/s.

### AGN Classification

The AGN type I/II classification depends only on the orientation. So if the broad-line region is exposed to the observer we call the AGN, type I.

In polarized light both types of AGNs look the same.

## Spectral properties of AGNs

### SED contribution of different regions

- UV/optical: accretion disk, following a power law
- Mid-IR: hot dust and torus
- Far-IR: cold dust and the host galaxy, due to star formation

### The x-ray spectrum

For x-ray observations we need both soft/hard band photometry, to then confirm the presence of an AGN a color should be present.

### The optical spectrum

We can construct a BPT diagram, then galaxies containing AGNs can be found in the upper right corner.
