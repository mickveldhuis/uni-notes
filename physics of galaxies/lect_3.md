# Lecture 3: Stellar Populations 

## Stellar Properties

- Effective temperature $T_\text{eff}$: $$L\equiv 4\pi R^2\sigma T_\text{eff}^2s$$
- Surface gravity $\log g$: causes, among others, pressure broadening, $$g=\frac{GM}{R^2}$$
- Metallicity $Z$ or $[\text{Fe}/\text{H}]$: Metals are everything heavier than helium. $$[A/B]=\log\bigg\{\frac{\#\text{atoms A}/\#\text{atoms B}}{(\#\text{atoms A}/\#\text{atoms B})_\odot}\bigg\}$$ Higher $Z$ (and $\log g$) will lead to more prominent absorption. 

Note that the metallicity will change the MS turnoff and shift the isochrones. On top of that the effective temperature, luminosity, and opacity depend on $Z$. Thus higher $Z$ more absorption, leading to cooler stars.

## Spectral Differences for Different Types of Galaxies

Early type, e.g. ellipticals and lenticulars, have very low flux at lower wavelengths ($\lambda < 4000\ \text{\AA}$). Whereas late type galaxy, e.g. starburst galaxies,tend to have higher flux in the UV range (and below) than in the visible and IR part of the spectrum. On top of that late type galaxies have prominent emission lines.

## K-correction

The K-correction corrects for the fact that sources observed at different redshifts are, in general, compared with standards or each other at different rest-frame wavelengths. We can relate the wavelength of the observed versus emitted photon via $\lambda_o=\lambda_e(1+z)$.

## Statistical Properties of Stars

### Stellar luminosity function

The stellar luminosity function is a measure of the number density of stars per unit of volume and per unit of luminosity (or absolute magnitude).

$$dN=\Phi(M, V)\,dM\,dV$$

If the distribution of stars of different luminosities is homogeneous in space:

$$dN=[\Phi(M)\,dM][\nu(V)\,dV]$$

Source surveys are apparent magnitude limited, i.e. the LF is affected by the Malmquist bias, meaning that the absolute magnitude of the observed sample is brighter than the mean of the full stellar population.

### The initial mass function (IMF)

The [IMF](https://www.astro.caltech.edu/~george/ay20/Ay20-Lec17x.pdf), which we today know should be a broken power law, describes the distribution of stellar masses in a newly formed stellar population. A well known IMF is the [Salpeter IMF](http://astro1.physics.utoledo.edu/~megeath/ph6820/lecture12_eqn.pdf),

$$\Psi(M)=\Psi_0M^{-2.35}$$

Where $M$ is the stellar mass. The IMF represents the number of stars with masses in a certain range, within a specified volume of space

## Star Clusters

### Globular clusters

- Very compact
- Around $10^3$-$10^4$ stars
- Contain some of the oldest stars (they constitute to a very tight sequence in the HR-diagram)
- Low metallicities (compared to the rest of the host galaxy)
- They set a minimum of the age of the host galaxy

### Open clusters

- Low mass
- Less than 1000 stars
- Young and they don't last very long
- Member stars have the same composition
