# Lecture 12: Spiral & Elliptical Galaxies II


## Spirals

### Spiral structure in disk galaxies

- 10% are grand design, very big galaxies with two well defined spiral arms
- 60% have multiple spiral arms, with slightly less structured spiral arms
- 30% are flocculent spirals, barely visible spiral arms, the arms are hard to distinguish

Leading spiral arms are pointing in the direction of rotation, if they are opposite to the rotation we call them trailing spiral arms.

### Density waves

The local gravitational field is not constant, as the density of matter at different times will be different. Which causes density waves, these wave resist the spiral's tendency to wind up and cause a rigidly rotating spiral pattern.

### Self-propagating star formation

Star formation produces supernovae, which will shock the gas, and triggers more star formation in the process. Then differential rotation stretches out the regions of star formation into trailing fragmentary arms with no global symmetry.

This process could explain the flocculant spiral structure.

## Ellipticals 

### The centres of elliptical galaxies

Ellipticals either have a cusp, mainly in intermediate ellipticals (non-flat light curve at the centre), or core, giant ellipticals (flat light curve at the centre).

Cores could be due to mergers, such that the central nucleus is more diffuse. They might also be caused by *dry mergers*, without new gas, and thus barely any new star formation.

The cusp might be the result of *wet mergers*, i.e. mergers bringing in new gas.

Additionally, there are also dwarf ellipticals. They are are really faint.

### Shapes of ellipticals

We can, in the most general case, express the luminosity density $\rho(x)$ as $\rho(m^2)$,

$$m^2=\frac{x^2}{\alpha^2}+\frac{y^2}{\gamma^2}+\frac{z^2}{\beta^2}$$

If all parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$ are different, the galaxy is triaxial. If $\alpha=\gamma < \beta$, the galaxy is prolate. And lastly if $\alpha=\gamma > \beta$, the galaxy is oblate.

### Deviation from elliptical isophotes

The diskiness/boxiness of an isophote (curves of equal brightness) can be classified by the difference between the real isophote and the best-fit ellipse.

### Boxy/disky & isophotal twisting

Note because the ellipticity changes with radius they will appear as if they will appear as if they were rotated in the projected image. This is called isophote twisting.

- Boxy galaxies: more luminous, more likely to show isophote twists, probably triaxial.
- Disky galaxies: intermediate ellipticals, often oblate, faster rotators.

### Slow and fast rotators

In minor mergers there is a higher transfer of angular momentum. The energy in major mergers is distributed differently.

### Fine structure in ellipticals

About 10-20% of ellipticals show distinct shells, which is probably the result of accretion (or mergers) of a small galaxy that was on a nearly radial orbit.

Density waves can produce ripples in the galaxy.

## Spectral properties

### Absorption lines

Mainly caused by atoms, molecules in a star's atmosphere (stellar lines). They can also be due to cold gas in the ISM, which extracts energy from the passing radiation (interstellar lines).

In ellipticals absorption lines are very important, as good as no emission lines, due to very little new star formation.

### Emission lines

Caused by gas being ionized and heated and then re-radiating at specific wavelengths. Young stars produce this ionized gas, due to UV photons being emitted. So emission lines tell you about the presence of young stellar populations.

For instance the spectra of spiral galaxies are characterized by the presence of emission lines. A prominent indicator of (a lot of) star formation is the $\text{H}\alpha$ line.

## Black holes in the centre of ellipticals

If a super-massive black hole lives at the centre of a galaxy, we should be able to detect this by looking at the speeds of stars that pass near to the black hole. We look for rotational speeds where

$$V^2(r)\approx\frac{GM_\text{BH}}{r}\gtrapprox\sigma_e^2$$

where $\sigma_c$ is the velocity dispersion of the stars at the centre. Which is within a radius

$$r_\text{BH}=45\ \text{pc}\bigg(\frac{M_\text{BH}}{10^8\ \text{M}_\odot}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\sigma_c}{100\ \text{km/s}}\bigg)$$

### BH mass/bulge-velocity relation

It is likely that every elliptical galaxy, even every spheroidal system, for instance bulges, have a super massive black hole.

$$\log (M_\text{BH}/\text{M}_\odot)=4.24\log(\sigma/200\ \text{km/s})+8.12$$

And because $M_\text{bulge}\propto\sigma^2 r$,

$$\frac{M_\text{BH}}{M_\text{bulge}}=2.2\cdot 10^{-3}$$
