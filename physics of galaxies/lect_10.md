# Lecture 10: Spirals & Ellipticals I

## Plots of number density versus stellar mass/luminosity

One sees that at higher stellar masses, the shape will decline exponentially. Whereas at low mass the graph looks like a power-law. Most of the mass is around the turning point of the stellar mass function, this is in between where the bulk of spirals and ellipticals. 

## Sersic profiles

$$\mu(r)=\mu_e+8.3268\bigg[\bigg(\frac{r}{r_e}\bigg)^{1/n}-1\bigg]$$

This formalism can be used to discriminate between disk-dominated and bulge-dominated galaxies.

## Measuring the surfae brightness

The surface brightness $I(x)$ is the amount of light contained in an area at a particular point x in an image. The surface brightness is given by

$$I(x)=\frac{F}{\alpha^2}$$

where $\alpha=D/d$, $D$ width of galaxy, $d$ distance to galaxy. Note that the surface brightness does not change with distance.

$$\mu_\lambda(x)=-2.5\log I_\lambda(x)+\text{constant}_\lambda$$

## Cosmological dimming (Tolman test)

Surface brightness $B=f/d\omega$, $\omega$ is a solid angle. 

$$B=\frac{L}{d_L^2}\frac{d_A^2}{dl^2}$$

In non-Euclidean space $d_L=d(1+z)$ and $d_A=d/(1+z)$, such that

$$B=\frac{L}{dl^2(1+z)^{-4}}$$

## Sources of error in surface brightness

- Sky background subtraction: i.e. if the sky is over or under subtracted.
- Seeing effects: unresolved points are spread out due to effects of our atmosphere, quantified by a PSF. If you don't take seeing into account the central part will be flatter and the isophotes rounder.

## Surface brightness ellipticals

Ellipticals have very smooth profiles over 2 orders of magnitude in radius, which usually falling off as $R^{1/4}$.

## Surface brightness (bulge + disc)

The disk has an exponential profile $I(R)=I_0\exp(-R/h_R)$, $$\mu(R)=\mu_0+1.09\bigg(\frac{R}{h_R}\bigg)$$. And the bugle follows an $r^{1/4}$ law.

Stars in the bulge and disk probably have different origins.

## Colors of ellipticals and spirals

Galaxies get bluer as the disks become more prominent, on top of that they'll become fainter.

## Rotational curves of disk galaxies

$$v_r=\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda_{\text{HI}}}c$$

When viewed at an inclination the radial velocity is given by

$$v_r(R, i) = v_\text{sys}+v(r)\cos\phi\sin i$$

## Three main classes of rotation curves 

1. Nearly constant velocity at all radii
2. The typical increase in the beginning (rigid body regime) and then a constant velocity due to differential rotation.
3. A slow rise in the beginning (typical for dwarf irregulars)

## HI rotation curves and disk galaxies

The rotation curve depends on mass, not luminosity, so we need to transform the surface brightness profile to a mass profile using the mass-luminosity relation.

$$v^2(R)=v_\text{disk}^2(R)+v_\text{bulge}^2(R)$$

A flat rotation curve is due to additional matter, i.e. dark matter.

## The Tully-Fisher relation

In spiral galaxies a relation exists between its luminosity and maximum rotational velocity, $L\propto v_\text{max}^4$. Note: the exponent changes with bandpass.

So there is a link between the stellar mass (luminosity) of a disk and the mass of the dark matter halo.

Note that the mass-to-light ratio $M/L$ depends on the age, star formation history, dust extinction, etc.

## Rotational velocities nellipticals from stellar absorption lines

The absorption lines are a composite spectrum of all the stars in the galaxy. The broadening can tell you about the gas kinematics.

## Scaling relations for ellipticals

A relation between the luminosity and the (central) velocity dispersion (The Faber-Jackson relation),

$$L\propto\sigma^4$$

## The fundamental plane for ellipticals

The fundamental plane is a correlation in a 3D space, 

$$R\propto \sigma^{1.24}\bar{I}_e^{-0.82}$$

The mass-to-light ratios of ellipticals increases as they become more luminous, like due to larger galaxies being older.

$$\frac{M}{L}\propto L^{1/4}$$
