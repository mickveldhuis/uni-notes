# Lecture 13: Chemical Enrichment & Galaxy Growth

## Chemical Enrichment

### Closed-box model

$$Z(t)=-p\ln\bigg[\frac{M_g(t)}{M_g(0)}\bigg]$$

where $p=\text{cst}$ is the metal yield and $M_g$ is the (interstellar) gas mass. So as the gas mass decreases the metallicity increases.

### Star formation tracers

- Emission lines, particularly Balmer lines
- Mid-IR peak(s), due to PAHs
- far-IR/sub-mm emission
- Rest UV light

### Star formation quenching

#### Early-type star formation quenching

1. Pre-quenching: Two galaxies on main sequence are about to merge, both bring in gas reservoir and are connected to cosmic gas flow.
2. Quenching: Merger may drive SDR above main sequence or not. Morphology becomes spheroid. Lots of outflowing gas, causes depletion of the cold gas reservoir. Further cosmological inflows/cooling stopped.
3. Post-quenching: SFR drops rapidly to zero and the galaxy moves to the green valley. Gas reservoir is destroyed. AGN becomes active.
4. (Far) Post-quenching: Galaxy becomes a passive red sequence galaxy.

#### Late-type star formation quenching

1. Pre-quenching: Galaxy is on main sequence, and $M_\star\propto\text{SFR}^\beta$. Inflows balance outflows, the system in quasi-equilibrium.
2. Quenching: Gas reservoir is no longer replenished, thus the galaxy leaves the main sequence. Note: $\text{SFR}=\varepsilon M_\text{gas}/\tau_\text{dyn}$.
3. Post-quenching: SFR goes into exponential decline, galaxy enters the green valley. Gas reservoir is slowly used up.
4. (Far) Post-quenching: Galaxy has become a passive red spiral galaxy (so morphological transformation). Very low SFR.

## High Redshift Galaxies

### The cosmic SFR density

Galaxy formation and growth was much more efficient in the past.

## Selection of High Redshift Galaxies

The Lyman-break selection technique. If we change the set of filters, the technique can be extended to select higher redshift galaxies. But the technique is biased against dusty galaxies.

### Lyman-break galaxies versus Lyman-alpha emitters

Note: Lyman-break galaxies are not necessarily Ly$\alpha$ emitters. The Ly$\alpha$ line profile depends on the ability of Ly$\alpha$ photons to escape dusty ISM. However there's one problem, namely resonant scattering of photons with neutral hydrogen.

### Optical versus NIR Surveys

Previously the search of $z>1.5$ galaxies was done primarily on optical images. However using NIR, it has been shown that optical images miss a lot of high redshift galaxies. 

## Physics of High Redshift Galaxy Evolution

### Observational constraints - the SFR-$M_\star$ plane

Starbursts may be more important than was thought a few years ago. But one needs to look for them among galaxies with lower stellar masses $M_\star$.

### Searching for galaxy outflows

Evidence of outflows in spectra:

- Velocity offsets of emission and absorption lines.
  - Redshifted Ly$\alpha$
  - Blueshifted interstellar absorption
- Stellar photospheric features are too weak to detect, so we need to gues the systemic redshift.

## Dusty Galaxies at High Redshifts

Dust was very common in galaxies at $z\approx 2-4$, at which time the universe was 1.5-3.5 Gyr old. Dust is rare in the first billion years, but evidence of dust has been found in galaxies up to $z\approx 7-8$
