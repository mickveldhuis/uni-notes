# Lecture 9 Reionization & First Galaxies

## The evolution of the universe 

(1) After the big bang and before the recombination the particles were in thermal equilibrium. (2) Recombination, i.e. the moment at which charged electrons and protons first became bound to form hydrogen atoms. (3) The cosmic dawn, the moment at which the first stars and galaxies came into existence (4) Nowadays, basically all H and He is fully ionized (outside of the galaxies).

## Hydrogen reionization

- Pre overlap phase: each galaxy builds a region of ionized hydrogen around itself, the Stromgren sphere.
- Overlap phase: ionized spheres grow and start merging.
- Post overlap phase: really large ionized regions, merging with the left-over neutral islands.

## Thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium

At recombination the universe was at thermal equilibrium, then the universe started to cool adiabatically, i.e.

$$pV^\gamma=\text{constant}$$

Using the ideal gas law $pV=NkT$, with $\gamma=5/3$ for a monoatomic gas, we find

$$T\propto V^{-2/3}\propto a^{-2}$$

where $a=1/(1+z)$ is the scale factor, such that

$$T\propto (1+z)^2$$

Note that at the beginning $a=0$ and $z=\infty$, while today we have $a=1$ with $z=0$.

## Sources of reionization

Main point: more and more galaxies form and galaxies become more and more massive over time.

Gravity causes the initial fluctuations in the density field  to  grow  over  time,  i.e. slightly   over-dense   regions increase   their   density   and become  more  confined,  while slightly  under-dense  regions become more under-dense. Galaxies  form  in  the  density peaks.    The    most    massive galaxies  have  formed  in  the very first density peaks, while less   massive   galaxies   have formed later. At  each  time  there  are  far more  low  massive  galaxies than very massive galaxies.

Note: there are more fainter than brighter galaxies in general, because of the concentration of over-densities/under-densities. And the number of galaxies increase as the universe evolves, as the under-densities become more dense, such that galaxies can be formed there as well.

## Physical processes that affect the contribution of galaxies to reionization

1. Only a fraction of the photons escapes due to HI in the ISM.
2. Supernovae winds and heating lead to gas being ejected from the galaxy.
3. Reionization heats gas in the IGM & reduces cool gas for star formation.

Note 2 and 3 mainly have effect in smaller mass/fainter galaxies, whereas 1 dominates in brighter galaxies. This dictates how many stars can be formed in a galaxy.

## Reionization feedback on galaxies

The virial temperature of a halo with virial mass $M$ at redshift $z$ is given as

$$T=1.69\cdot 10^4\bigg(\frac{\mu}{0.6}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{\Omega_M}{0.3}\bigg)^{1/3}\bigg(\frac{1+z}{10}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{hM_{\text{vir}}}{10^8 M_\odot}\bigg)$$

where $\mu$ is the molecular mass and $\Omega_M$ the matter density parameter.

## The Stromgren sphere

What is the size of the ionized sphere around a galaxy? We assume that the rate of ionizations equals that of recombinations. The ionization rate $N_\text{ion}=\alpha n_e n_p V$, where the volume $V=4\pi R_s^3/3$. Such that the radius of the sphere is given by

$$R_s=\bigg(\frac{3N_\text{ion}}{4\pi\alpha n_e n_p}\bigg)^{1/3}$$

## Key physics of reionization

An expression for the ionization fraction of hydrogen is given by,

$$\frac{dQ_\text{HII}}{dt}=\frac{\dot{n}_\text{ion}}{\bar{n}_\text{H}}-\frac{Q_\text{HII}}{\bar{t}_\text{rec}}$$

the first term on the RHS denotes the ionization rate and the second the recombination rate. Note that 

$$\dot{n}_\text{ion}=f_\text{esc}\dot{n}_\text{ion}^\text{ISM}$$

and

$$\bar{t}_\text{rec}=\big(\chi_e\bar{n}_\text{H}\alpha_B C\big)^{-1}$$

where $\chi_e$ accounts of excess in free electrons due to ionized helium, $\alpha_B$ is the case-B recombination coefficient, and $C=\langle n^2\rangle/\langle n\rangle^2$. Note that for a homogeneous system the clumping factor is one. And if the gas only consists of hydrogen: $\chi_e = 1$.

## Observational evidence for reionization

### Electron scattering

The electron scattering optical depth is given by

$$\tau_e=\int^{z_\text{reion}}\sigma_T n_e \frac{dl}{dz}\,dz$$

From the CMB optical depth we can infer an instantaneous reionization redshift. $\tau_e=0.055\pm 0.009$, $\sigma_T$ the Thomson scattering cross section.

### Lyman-$\alpha$ photons

Photon wavelengths will be shifted by a factor $1+z$. Using a Gunn-Peterson trough we can detect this shift. For instance 

- Quasar emits radiation
- Radiation travels as Universe expands & is redshifted
- Neutral hydrogen in the IGM absorbs Lyman-$\alpha$ always at 1206 Å
- Quasar spectra shows absorption at wavelengths shorter than 1206 Å

If the photons of the quasar spectra passes the neutral gas in the IGM during reionization, they are nearly completely absorbed at wavelengths shorter than 1206 Å (in the rest frame of the quasar!)

### Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters

- Stars in the galaxy emit HI ionizing photons
- Ionizing photons are absorbed by HI in the interstellar medium (ISM)
- Ionized hydrogen in dense clumps recombines quickly
- Lyman-$\alpha$ is emitted as part of recombination radiation

Ly$\alpha$ line has been redshifted out of HI absorption. It is transmitted through the IGM.

The larger the ionized regions around a galaxy, the higher is its fraction of Ly$\alpha$ radiation that is transmitted through the IGM.

The decrease of galaxies with a detected Ly$\alpha$ line could be due to a higher HI fraction.
