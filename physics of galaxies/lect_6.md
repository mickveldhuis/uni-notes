# Lecture 6: Milky Way I

## The multi-wavelength view

- NIR pictures are dominated by the older stars, such that the bulge is best observed in the NIR.
- Molecular hydrogen (i.e. the fuel for stellar birth) is an indicator for the formation of new stars.
- Atomic hydrogen is observed by form instance the 21cm line.
- High intensity gamma rays in the galactic center indicate star formation.

## Galactic coordinates

The position of a star can be given by the angles $l$ and $b$, respectively the angle with respect to the sun-galactic center line in the galactic plane and the angle with respect to the galactic plane.

## Galactic cylindrical coordinates 

We also use $(R, \phi, z)$ coordinates to define the position of a star in the MW.

## Galactic Cartesian coordinates

In case of using Cartesian coordinates $x$ is radially outward (from the galactic center), $y$ in the direction of the sun's rotation around the MW, and $z$ out of the galactic plane, positive towards the NGP.

## Stellar density of disk galaxies

We can approximate the stellar density in the disc as double exponential

$$n(R, z, S) = n(0,0,S)\exp\big[-R/h_R(S)\big]\exp\big[-|z|/h_z(S)\big]$$

$h_R$ and $h_z$ are characteristic scale lengths, representing the the lengths over which the density falls by a factor of $e$ for some (stellar) population $S$.

## The MW disk

The thick disk is mainly composed of dwarf stars, and contains no O, B, A type stars. Those are mainly found in the thin disk. In a similar fashion, most older stars are found farther out from the galactic plane, whereas younger stars are predominantly found close to the galactic plane.

## Analysis of MW components 

If we plot $V$ (the rotation velocity) versus $T$ then the location of stars in the MW are very clearly denoted in groups. Note that $T=\sqrt{U^2+W^2}$, where $U$ is the velocity component towards the galactic center and $W$ is the component towards the north galactic pole.

Similarly plotting the iron abundance $[\text{Fe/H}]$ versus $V$ shows a similar trend.

## The MW disks (stars)

The thin disk stars make up 90% of the stars near the sun. And integrated over the $z$-direction the thick disk has about a third of the intensity of the thin disk. 

The vertical distribution of stars in the Milky cannot be fit by single exponential curve. There is only a good fit with two exponentials. So  either (1) the functional form (exponential) is incorrect or (2) there are two physically distinct components of the disk of the Galaxy: a thin and a thick disk. For the second possibility to be correct, need to conclusively demonstrate that they have different and distinct properties!

## The MW disks (gas)

The neutral hydrogen gas is rather concentrated around the galactic plane, which is even more so for molecular gas. 

## Stars in the MW halo

Looking even farther out from the plane of the Galaxy, it appears that the disk turns into a much more tenuous stellar halo. Whose density profile is given by

$$n(r)\approx n_0\bigg(\frac{r}{r_0}\bigg)^{-3}$$

Note this relation is only valid until about a radius of $R\approx 20\ \text{kpc}$. They might tell something about the minor merger history. This stellar halo extends to about 80 kpc and it is about 1% of the luminosity of the MW.

The stellar halo is very important for understanding the formation of the Milky Way, as the stars are generally very old and metal-poor. The stellar halo preserves the early formation history of the Galaxy.
