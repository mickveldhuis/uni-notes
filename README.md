# Astro/Maths/Physics/Misc notes
A collection of my notes. I don't know whether they are any good, but they serve(d) me well.

# What have I got notes on?
Currently I have notes on / am working on notes for:

- Electricity & magnetism
- Quantum mechanics
- Thermodynamics & statistical mechanics
- Statistics (from a bayesian perspective)
- Observational astronomy (covering a range of subjects relevant to astronomical observations. Such as coordinate systems, time, optics, etc.)
- Mathematical physics (covering series, 2nd order differential equations, fourier series / transforms, and partial differential equations)

# What will (probably) come?

Probably nothing. Typing up the notes currently simply takes too much time, resulting in little time left to actually spent on the subject. I might finish the summaries I am currently _working_ on, but after that I will most likely stop and revert to good 'ol paper notes.
