# Astro/Maths/Physics/Misc notes
A collection of my notes. I don't know whether they are any good, but they serve(d) me well.

# What have I got notes on?
Currently I have notes on / am working on notes for:

- Electricity & magnetism
- Quantum mechanics
- Thermodynamics & statistical mechanics
- Statistics (from a bayesian perspective)
- Observational astronomy (covering a range of subjects relevant to astronomical observations. Such as coordinate systems, time, optics, etc.)
- Mathematical physics (covering series, 2nd order differential equations, fourier series / transforms, and partial differential equations)

# What will (probably) come?
Subjects that I will probably add to this collection are 

- Complex analysis
- Waves & optics
- Numerical methods
- And more...
